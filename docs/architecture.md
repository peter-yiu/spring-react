# Backend Architecture

The backend architecture of the project is designed to follow the principles of a typical Spring Boot application, with a layered architecture separating concerns between different components.

## 1. Layers

### 1.1. Controller Layer

The controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them, and returning appropriate responses. It interacts with the service layer to perform business logic operations.

### 1.2. Service Layer

The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the application's logic and orchestrates interactions between the controller layer and the data access layer.

### 1.3. Data Access Layer

The data access layer interacts with the database or external data sources. It includes repositories, which are responsible for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database using Spring Data JPA.

## 2. Components

### 2.1. Book Controller

The `BookController` is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to book management. It exposes endpoints for CRUD operations on books.

### 2.2. Book Service

The `BookService` contains methods that encapsulate the business logic for book management. It interacts with the `BookRepository` to perform CRUD operations on books.

### 2.3. Book Repository

The `BookRepository` is an interface that extends Spring Data JPA's `JpaRepository`. It provides methods for performing CRUD operations on the `Book` entity.

### 2.4. Book Entity

The `Book` entity represents a book in the application. It contains attributes such as title, author, publication date, and description.

## 3. Flow

The flow of operations in the backend architecture is as follows:
1. An HTTP request is sent to the appropriate endpoint in the `BookController`.
2. The `BookController` invokes the corresponding method in the `BookService`.
3. The `BookService` performs the necessary business logic operations and interacts with the `BookRepository` to perform database operations.
4. The `BookRepository` executes CRUD operations on the database.
5. The result is returned back through the layers to the client as an ApiResponse.

## 4. Scalability and Extensibility

The backend architecture is designed to be scalable and extensible. New features can be added by creating additional controllers, services, and repositories following the same pattern. The modular structure allows for easy maintenance and updates.
